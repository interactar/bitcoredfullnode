# [[ PREREQUISITES ]]

```sh
sudo gpasswd -a $(whoami) docker 
```
* reboot your computer.

# [[ INTRO ]]

This orchestation uses three dockers:

*The Public Node which has enabled insight web/api, with out https certs.
*The Private Node which has a limited network access and limited plugins for security purposes.
*The Wallet Which is the BWS service and should be configured to talk with your public NODE.

You are able to run all this dockers in one server, also you can run each docker-compose on a different server.

Each docker-compose works with different branches, master is for livenet and testnet well is for testnet.
